            <p>We recently left our dog Barney with Katie and her family. From the moment we all met up we felt totally at ease and that we were leaving Barney in the best care and environment. Barney thoroughly enjoyed his stay and made a good friend in Katie's dog lilly ‚ù§Ô∏è I can't recommend Katie enough and we have other dates already booked in.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for taking such care of Buster boy! We called upon Katie when an unplanned hospital trip arose and she went above and beyond for us, from a home pick up to regular updates, nothing was too much trouble. You can tell that Katie‚Äôs love for dogs begins at tip of their nose to the end of the waggiest tails ‚ô•Ô∏èüêæ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
