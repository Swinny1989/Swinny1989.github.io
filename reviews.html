            <p>Katie‚Äôs K9s is absolutely amazing! I felt so reassured leaving my two little dogs in Katie‚Äôs care while my family and I took a short break. I got sent regular updates and photos, which I really appreciated! ü•∞ it was so lovely to see what they were up to and know they were happy and well looked after.</p>
            <p>Katie is incredibly professional, clearly loves what she does, and treats the dogs like her own. </p>
            <p>I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend her to anyone looking for a reliable, caring, and trustworthy dog boarder. 10/10 from me!</p>

            <p>I would highly recommend Katie, she is so loving and caring with my two spaniels and they just love going to hers. She provides them a home from home when we need to leave them, we always gets loads of updates and pictures of them having a fab time. It definitely makes leaving them much easier and gives a great peace of mind that they are in an environment they love. We are so glad to have found you Katie!</p>

            <p>Katie looked after our working cocker spaniel for three days and nights and Bee had an absolutely amazing time! I really appreciate the regular updates and photos as it makes being away so much easier, especially when you can see what great times they‚Äôre having! It was a hot weekend but Katie had lots of hot weather activities to keep them entertained and went out for early dog walks to avoid the heat which again just goes to highlight the really thoughtful home away from home care she provides for your furry child!</p>
