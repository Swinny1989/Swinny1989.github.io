            <h3>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10/10 – Absolutely Amazing!</h3>
            <p>Katie’s K9s is absolutely amazing! I felt so reassured leaving my two little dogs in Katie’s care while my family and I took a short break. I got sent regular updates and photos, which I really appreciated! 🥰 it was so lovely to see what they were up to and know they were happy and well looked after.</p>
            <p>Katie is incredibly professional, clearly loves what she does, and treats the dogs like her own. </p>
            <p>I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her to anyone looking for a reliable, caring, and trustworthy dog boarder. 10/10 from me!</p>

            <h3>Absolutely fantastic experience with Katie’s K9s!</h3>
            <p>Lola was so well looked after – it truly was a home away from home for her. Katie sent daily updates and lovely photos, which really put my mind at ease. It was clear that Lola was treated like one of the family, and she came home happy and relaxed.</p>
            <p>Highly recommend Katie if you’re looking for a warm, caring, and reliable family environment for your dog. I wouldn’t hesitate to book again!</p>

            <p>Katie has looked after our two dogs for week long stays in her home. They had the best time! We have two dogs who have never stayed in kennels, they are very nervy, I was so happy to find Katie's home boarding service. Her attention to their diets, routine, quirks 🙂 was fantastic. She ensured their meals and times were the same as at home keeping their digestive system calm which for our old doggos is important.</p>
            <p>We received lots of fab images of the dogs out playing and walking in the countryside...in fact I am thinking of booking myself in for a weeks holiday with Katie! 🙂  </p>
            <p>Very happy to 100% recommend Katie's service, she looks after the dogs as if they were her own.  Thank you Katie! Great job xxx</p>

            <p>I would highly recommend Katie's K9's! Our cockapoo, Humphrey, absolutely loves staying over! He gets so excited when he goes and is absolutely shattered when he comes home, which is amazing as he has so much energy! If you need a dog sitter for just a day, just one night or a long stay, Katie is your person! 🥰</p>

            <p>I would highly recommend Katie, she is so loving and caring with my two spaniels and they just love going to hers. She provides them a home from home when we need to leave them, we always gets loads of updates and pictures of them having a fab time. It definitely makes leaving them much easier and gives a great peace of mind that they are in an environment they love. We are so glad to have found you Katie!</p>

            <p>Katie looked after our working cocker spaniel for three days and nights and Bee had an absolutely amazing time! I really appreciate the regular updates and photos as it makes being away so much easier, especially when you can see what great times they’re having! It was a hot weekend but Katie had lots of hot weather activities to keep them entertained and went out for early dog walks to avoid the heat which again just goes to highlight the really thoughtful home away from home care she provides for your furry child!</p>

            <p>We recently left our dog Barney with Katie and her family. From the moment we all met up we felt totally at ease and that we were leaving Barney in the best care and environment. Barney thoroughly enjoyed his stay and made a good friend in Katie's dog lilly ❤️ I can't recommend Katie enough and we have other dates already booked in.</p>
